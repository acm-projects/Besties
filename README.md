<div align="center"> Have you ever sat down in a new class and stared at the nobodies around you? Wonder who they are, and what they're thinking? Well daydream no more! With Besties‚Ñ¢, you can quickly bond with your fellow students! Besties is a game similar to Kahoot where players connect to a server and get randomly matched together to solve trivia questions of increasing difficulty. Let's do what it takes to get CS students to actually talk to each other! </div>

## MVP üèÜ
